# Matcher for fingerprint features
# Uses OpenCV's BFMatcher for demonstration

# Matcher for fingerprint minutiae features
# This is a placeholder. Matching logic should be based on spatial proximity and orientation of minutiae points.

def match_minutiae_features(terminations1, bifurcations1, terminations2, bifurcations2, tolerance=15):
    """
    Simple matching: counts the number of minutiae points within a certain distance.
    Args:
        terminations1, bifurcations1: List of minutiae from image 1
        terminations2, bifurcations2: List of minutiae from image 2
        tolerance: Distance threshold for matching points
    Returns:
        int: Number of matched minutiae (very basic)
